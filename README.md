# Portfolio-v2
This project is a rough draft layout of a portfolio built to showcase information about my skillset and where to contact me, using React. This site was deployed using netlify at the following link : https://jlee12297-portfolio.netlify.app/ 
The portfolio site still needs a lot of work, with styling needed for the site, and contact form functionality. 
If using this project as a basic portfolio template, just run "npm i" to install all dependencies, and if deploying to netlify, follow netlify docs, or run "netlify deploy" for a simple guided deployment!
